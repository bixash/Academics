// Algorithm

two pointers FRONT and REAR
FRONT track the first element of the queue
REAR track the last elements of the queue
initially, set value of FRONT and REAR to -1


1. Enqueue Operation
-check if the queue is full
-for the first element, set value of FRONT to 0
-circularly increase the REAR index by 1 (i.e. if the rear -reaches the end, next it would be at the start of the queue)
-add the new element in the position pointed to by REAR


2. Dequeue Operation
check if the queue is empty
return the value pointed by FRONT
circularly increase the FRONT index by 1
for the last element, reset the values of FRONT and REAR to -1
However, the check for full queue has a new additional case:

Case 1: FRONT = 0 && REAR == SIZE - 1
Case 2: FRONT = REAR + 1

The second case happens when REAR starts from 0 due to circular increment and when its value is just 1 less than FRONT, the queue is full.
