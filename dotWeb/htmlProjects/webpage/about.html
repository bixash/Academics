        <p>
            <b>One leap ahead.</b>
            <br>Since 2010, we have been working with clients to imagine and build software that people love to use. And we think we're different.
            We care about who we work for and the quality of work we deliver, and the impact that makes. 
            And that shows in the results we produce together. Leapfrog is founded on a commitment to customer happiness , pride in craftsmanship, and making a difference.
